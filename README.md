# EMG Demonstration Game
A demostration game made in Processing IDE following arm movements generated by EMG signals feedback.

The game will train some of the users' skills with a tool where the user has to catch (in a more subtle way) some objects in movement. 
For example, the user holds a sword and tries to cut fruits in motion.
To add some form of randomness and various degrees of difficulty, a static box area is displayed indicating the object that can score. 
The same situation occurs with those that penalize. However, some pre-selected objects can be defined in the early stages of video game development.

## Introduction

The use of electromyography is often related to brain analysis, muscle analysis, use of robotic arms, therapies, etc. . But always within the field of medicine so it is often empathized with these terms with some fear. The ability to provide training games that are also fun is of vital importance [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40869-018-0060-0) to begin to acquire a mentality in society more familiar and comfortable with electromyography because, after all, in the coming decades future developments and applications go in this direction, bio-robotics.

Unfortunately, EMG-operated prosthetics are perceived as difficult to operate, causing many potential users to choose to wear much simpler prosthetics or none at all. [[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17979010)

## Graphical Interface

* Objective: Indicator of the objective, it can be any object that has been designed. If the player "hits" one of these moving targets, the score is increased.
* Scoring: Increases or decreases depending on the "hit" items.
* Right/left spawn: Items can reappear from right to left or from left to right.

### Dynamic elements

* Objects, both scoring and penalizing targets, will spawn randomly on the left or right in the opposite direction.
* The objects will describe a negative curve produced by gravity, as if it were an object thrown from the ends towards the centre.

### User input movements

* The user can rotate the avatar slightly to point the sword slightly to the left or right.
* At the moment of applying force with the sword, a sword strike occurs. This strike is done in a vertical direction and will make a sharp cut to any object that is in this area.
